## 1. Spring Cloud

Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state). Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed environment, including the developer’s own laptop, bare metal data centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.

### Springboot와 Spring Cloud

Spring Cloud를 사용하기 위해서는 Springboot가 필수적이며, Springboot의 버전과 Spring Cloud의 버전이 서로 호환되어야 함. 또한 boot의 버전에 따른 타 라이브러리 호환 문제도 고려해봐야함
